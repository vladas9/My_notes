## General form
$\Large F(y,y',y'',t) = 0$
>[!attention]
>There is no universal method to solve them

## Linear ODE
### General form
	$\Large p(t)y'' + q(t)y'+r(t)y = g(t)$
### Constant form
	$\Large ay'' + by'+cy = g(t)$
>[!example]
>$y'' + 9y = 0$
>$y'' = -9y$
>$y'=3y$ => $e^{3t} = g(t)$ => $y'=3e^{3t}=3y$
