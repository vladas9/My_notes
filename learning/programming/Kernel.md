# Kernel (operating system)
The **kernel** is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. On most systems, the kernel is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of startup as well as memory, peripherals, and input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit.
