# Single linked list
## Definition
>[!definition] 
>A single [[Linked list]] is a special type of linked list in which each node has only one link that points to the next node in the linked list.

## Characteristics of a Single Linked List:

- Each node holds a single value and a reference to the next node in the list.
- The list has a head, which is a reference to the first node in the list, and a tail, which is a reference to the last node in the list.
- The nodes are not stored in a contiguous block of memory, but instead, each node holds the address of the next node in the list.
- Accessing elements in a single linked list requires traversing the list from the head to the desired node, as there is no direct access to a specific node in memory.
## Application of Singly Linked Lists:

- **Memory management:** Singly linked lists can be used to implement memory pools, in which memory is allocated and deallocated as needed.
- **Database indexing**: Singly linked lists can be used to implement linked lists in databases, allowing for fast insertion and deletion operations.
- **Representing polynomials and sparse matrices:** Singly linked lists can be used to efficiently represent polynomials and sparse matrices, where most elements are zero.
- **Operating systems:** Singly linked lists are used in operating systems for tasks such as scheduling processes and managing system resources.

## Advantages of Singly Linked Lists:

- **Dynamic memory allocation**: Singly linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation, meaning that the size of the list can change at runtime as elements are added or removed.
- **Cache friendliness:** Singly linked lists can be cache-friendly as nodes can be stored in separate cache lines, reducing cache misses and improving performance.
- **Space-efficient:** Singly linked lists are space-efficient, as they only need to store a reference to the next node in each element, rather than a large block of contiguous memory.

## Disadvantages of Singly Linked Lists:

- **Poor random access performance**: Accessing an element in a singly linked list requires traversing the list from the head to the desired node, making it slow for random access operations compared to arrays.
- **Increased memory overhead:** Singly linked lists require additional memory for storing the pointers to the next node in each element, resulting in increased memory overhead compared to arrays.
- **Vulnerability to data loss:** Singly linked lists are vulnerable to data loss if a nodeâ€™s next pointer is lost or corrupted, as there is no way to traverse the list and access other elements.
- **Not suitable for parallel processing:** Singly linked lists are not suitable for parallel processing, as updating a node requires exclusive access to its next pointer, which cannot be easily done in a parallel environment.
- **Backward traversing not possible:** In singly linked list does not support backward traversing.

## Implementation in C

```C
struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node* next;
};
```
### Example of creating single linked list

```C
int main() {
    // Allocate memory for nodes
    struct Node* first = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node* second = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node* third = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node* fourth = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));


    first->data = 10;
    second->data = 20;
    third->data = 30;
    fourth->data = 40;

    first->next = second;
    second->next = third;
    third->next = fourth;
    fourth->next = NULL;
    // rest of the code
	// ...
}
```
