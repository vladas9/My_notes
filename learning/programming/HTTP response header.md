An HTTP response header is part of the response sent by a server to a client in response to an [HTTP request](protocols). It contains metadata about the response, such as the status code, content type, and other details. The response header is followed by the response body, which contains the actual data being sent back to the client.

### Structure of an HTTP Response Header

An HTTP response header consists of one or more lines of text, each containing a header name and a value, separated by a colon. The header lines are terminated by a carriage return and a line feed (CRLF) sequence. The header is terminated by an empty line, after which the response body (if any) follows.

Here's an example of a simple HTTP response header:
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-Type: text/plain 
Content-Length: 12
```

In this example, `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` is the status line, indicating that the request was successful. The `Content-Type` header specifies that the content of the response is plain text, and the `Content-Length` header specifies the length of the response body in bytes.

### Why is the Response Header Important?

The response header is important because it provides essential information to the client about the response, such as whether the request was successful (`200 OK`), whether the client needs to take further action (e.g., redirect), and how to interpret the content of the response (e.g., content type).

In your web server implementation, the `response_headers` string is used to construct the response header that will be sent back to the client along with the response body (JSON data). It specifies that the response is an HTTP/1.1 `200 OK` response with a content type of `application/json` and includes the length of the JSON response body. This ensures that the client can correctly parse and process the response.


### Other meta data
1. **Date**: Indicates the date and time when the response was generated.
```Json
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 2024 12:00:00 GMT
```
2. **Server**: Specifies information about the server software.
```json
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Unix)
```
3. **Cache-Control**: Specifies caching directives for the client and intermediaries.
```json
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```
4. **Content-Encoding**: Specifies the encoding applied to the response body.
```json
Content-Encoding: gzip
```
5. **Content-Disposition**: Specifies presentation information for the browser to display the response body, such as suggesting a filename for download.
```Json
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="example.txt"
```
 6. **Location**: Specifies a URL to redirect the client to.
```Json
Location: http://www.example.com/new_location
```
 7. **Set-Cookie**: Sets a cookie on the client's browser.
```Json
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```
8. **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource in a cross-origin request.
```Json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```
9. **Content-Language**: Specifies the language of the content.
```Json
Content-Language: en-US
```

These headers provide additional context and instructions to the client and intermediaries about how to handle and interpret the response. They are crucial for controlling caching behavior, specifying content characteristics, managing sessions, and enabling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), among other things.
