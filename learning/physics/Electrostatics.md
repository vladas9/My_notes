# Charge 
**Charge** is property of particles, there are 2 types of charge, positive and negative
- like **charges** repel
- opposite **charges** attract

The unite of charge is called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Coulomb</mark> (C)
## Elementary charge 
The elementary charge is charge of a **proton**(+) and **electron**(-)

- The charge of a **proton** is denoted by *e*
- The charge of a **electron** by *-e*
1 C (Coulomb) $\large = 6.24 * 10^{18} e$     =>     $\large e=1.6 * 10^{-19} C$ 
# Coulomb law (**Coulomb's inverse-square law**)
 The magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them.
 $$\Large |F| = k_e \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$
$$\Large k_e = 9 * 10^9 \frac{N * m^2}{C^2}$$
# Law of Conservation of Charge
The sum of charges in a closed space(a space were no charge come in or out) is always constant
$$\Large ^*\Sigma \space q = const$$
# Conductors and Insulators
 - A **conductor**, or electrical conductor, is a substance or material that allows electricity to flow through it. In a **conductor** electrons can move freely from one atom to another 
 - **Insulator**, any of various substances that block or retard the flow of electrical or thermal currents. In a **insulator** electrons can move freely from one atom to another
