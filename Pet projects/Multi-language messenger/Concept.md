# Concept 1
To make a light weight messenger, with as a core feature a build in AI agent that will auto-translate all text in other  languages, except that you selected as the main, to you own, and it will try to not simply translate it but also to adapt the meaning as precise as possible
It will be something similar to telegram by functionality 

# languages to use
### Frontend
- For both iOS and android I can use <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">react native</mark> (JavaScript), also it can be adapt for web
### Backend
- For backend I will use <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">node.js with JavaScript or TypeScript</mark> or both)
