# Introduction
1. "We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organize our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others." (page 8) ^554e57
2. "We write down not only those things we fear we won’t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memories." (page 8) ^7b2faa
3. "The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?" (page 9)
4. "Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there." (page 10) ^aa9d49
5. "To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic." (page 10) ^012580
