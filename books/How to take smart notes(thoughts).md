# Introduction
1. Writing is everywhere  in our life, we trying to write down every think that we think we will need. I think this happens because writing is one of the simplest way to fix information and keep it for you, it also can create a illusion that you learn something or become smarter , or simple don't miss something. In my opinion writing is one of the main way to keep information, because across generations it was the way that was taught to us.

2. The quality of the knowledge and feature notes and works, depends on what you done before, if you already have some peaces of knowledge that you noted for you in past it will be easier in feature to write something on a related them, so is a great practice to make notes, collect them and link them one with other.
