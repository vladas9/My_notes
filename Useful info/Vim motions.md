## Baby Steps

- `h` move cursor to the left
- `j` move down
- `k` move up
- `l` move right
- `i` Go into Insert mode
- `<ESC>``<C-C>``<C-[>` Go back to Normal mode

## Move Fast Word by Word

- `w` move to the beginning of next word
- `b` move to the beginning of the previous word
- `e` move to the end of the next word
- `ge` move to the end of the previous word

- `W` move to the beginning of next WORD

- `E` move to the end of the next WORD
- `gE` move to the end of the previous WORD

## Find Character

- `f{character}` Find next occurrence of character
- `F{character}` Find previous occurrence of character

- `t{character}` Find next occurrence of character and place cursor just before it
- `T{character}` Find previous occurrence of character and place cursor just before it

## Move Extremely Horizontally

- `0` Moves to the first character of a line

## High Precision Vertical Motions with Search

## Move Faster with Counts

## More Nifty Core Motions

## Multiple Cursors

Based on Search

- `<CMD-D>``<C-D>``gb` Adds an additional cursor. This command puts you in visual mode. In effect, it selects all the words under each new cursor at once.

- `I` Insert before multiple words at the same time
- `A` Append after multiple words at the same time

In Consecutive Rows

## Integrating with Neovim

- `:execute "{ex-command}"` Execute string as an Ex command. Useful in combination with normal when the normal mode commands include special characters.

- `:[range]global!/{pattern}/{command}` Execute an Ex command on lines within a range that do not match a pattern.
